## What is it?

This library is aimed at assisting researchers in the field of generalized OOD detection. It is inspired by [HF's Transformers](https://https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and provides a set of tools to run benchmarks, evaluate detectors, and compare them. It includes:

- More than 15 detection methods implemented.
- Pipelines for evaluating OOD detectors on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet benchmarks.
- Automatic OOD datasets download with md5 checksums.
- Support models implemented at [`timm`](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models).
- Models on CIFAR integrated at `timm`.
- Random seed support for reproducible simulations.
- Implementation of fast OOD evaluation metrics.
- Several aggregation methods for multi-layer OOD detection.
- Pipelines for open set recognition and covariate drift detection.

## Installation

```bash
pip install detectors
```

To install the latest version from the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edadaltocg/detectors.git
cd detectors
pip install -e .
```

## Examples

### Running a benchmark

```python
import detectors

model = detectors.create_model(args.model, pretrained=True)
test_transform = detectors.create_transform(model)

pipeline = detectors.create_pipeline("ood_benchmark_cifar10", transform=test_transform)
method = detectors.create_detector(method_name, model=model)

pipeline_results = pipeline.run(method)
print(pipeline.report(pipeline_results["results"]))
```

### Optional: Acceleration

This package is compatible with the `accelerate` package to allow for parallel computing.

In order to use it, you need to install it:

```bash
pip install accelerate
```

Then, you can configure it:

```bash
accelerate config
```

And finally, you can run the benchmark with the `accelerate` command:

```bash
accelerate launch demo/ood_benchmark.py
```
